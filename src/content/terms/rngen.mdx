Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.

## No Liability

You need to be aware that the Service Provider stores all personal data provided by you on their servers. The Service Provider will make all reasonable efforts to secure your data, but cannot guarantee its absolute security due to limitations beyond their control (for example, the internet, third-party storage facilities).

The Application was developed to function as declared, and the Service Provider strives to ensure its efficient operation. However, the Service Provider does not warrant that the functions contained in the Application will be uninterrupted or error-free, nor that issues will be corrected, nor that the Application is compatible with any particular hardware or software.
